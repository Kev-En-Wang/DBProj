# JDBC-App
SUPER SUPER SUPER rudimentary app made in 2 days.
 
Creates a database in mysql on boot, change the connection query accordingly to fit your own server and this app creates the database with a few entries.
Uses prepared statements, and all that good sql security stuff. Could use more work on the front end but as a little project to practice mysql and database
integration it seems sufficient. Not gonna touch this, just here so I don't lose it someday.
